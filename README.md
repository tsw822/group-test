请各位组员从以下2-10题目中自选一个完成，完成后上传到repo， 新建一个分支（请不要直接merge到main或者master分枝上）分枝命名：您的昵称每个字的大写字母（如 期待明天 为QDMT）下划线加题目号（如QDMT_5）然后push到repo， 并发起一个marge request到主枝。 如果有问题可以在群里讨论或者youtube找相关教程和视频（有很多）

我做完第一题示范一下。

题目如下:

1. Write a loop that asks the user for a number of rows and then prints out a pattern that looks like this:
#######
######
#####
####
###
##
#
2. Take a distance in kilometers as input and output the same distance converted to miles.
3. Pig Latin
Write a program that accepts a sentence as input and converts each word to “Pig Latin.” In one version, to convert a word to Pig Latin you remove the letters up to the first vowel and place that letter at the end of the word. Then you append the string “ay” to the word. Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT

Pig Latin: IAY EPTSLAY OSTMAY OFAY ETHAY IGHTNAY

4.Use 2 functions to display the number of vowels and consonants in a string that you prompt the user to enter.
5. If 254 is code for bed write a program that decrypts a string made from an encoded sentence that the user inputs.
6. Write a program that prints the short form for a month given it's proper name. For instance October => Oct.
7.Write a program to calculate the volume of a cylinder. The user enters in the diameter of the end of the circle, and the height in meters:
volume = pi * r ** 2 * height

8.Input the radius and height
Output the radius and height as they were input
Output the volume of the cylinder
Sample Output
radius >4
height >4
the volume is 201 cubic meters
Average calorie intake

9.Within a healthy, balanced diet, a man needs around 10,500kJ (2,500kcal) a day to maintain his weight. For a woman, that figure is around 8,400kJ (2,000kcal) a day.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the number of calories for 7 days and then prints the weekly average.

Sample Output
Enter your calories for day 1: 2490
Enter your calories for day 2: 2234
Enter your calories for day 3: 2768
Enter your calories for day 4: 2800
Enter your calories for day 5: 2900
Enter your calories for day 6: 2700
Enter your calories for day 7: 2200
Your average calories for 7 days was 2584.5714285714284

10.Word count
Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns the number of words that the string contains.

Hint Look for whitespace and punctuation

The application should let the user enter a string and should display the number of words that it contains.
example:
enter a string "I am just a poor boy from a poor family. Spare me my life for this one atrocity."
the string contains 18 words
